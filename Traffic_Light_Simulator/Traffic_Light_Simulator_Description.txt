Traffic Light Code Explanation
1. Pin Definitions
#define RED 1
#define YELLOW 2
#define GREEN 3


Defines pin numbers with names:

RED LED → Pin 11

YELLOW LED → Pin 12

GREEN LED → Pin 13

Using names instead of raw numbers makes the code more readable.


2. Setup Function
void setup() {
    pinMode(RED,OUTPUT);
    pinMode(YELLOW,OUTPUT);
    pinMode(GREEN,OUTPUT);
}


Runs once when the Arduino starts or resets.

Sets pins 11, 12, and 13 as OUTPUT, so Arduino can send signals to the LEDs.

3. Loop Function

The loop runs continuously, cycling through the traffic light sequence.

Red Light

digitalWrite(RED,1);
digitalWrite(YELLOW,0);
digitalWrite(GREEN,0);

delay(5000);


Turns the Red LED ON.

Keeps Yellow and Green OFF.

Stays in this state for 5 seconds.

Yellow Light

digitalWrite(RED,0);
digitalWrite(YELLOW,1);
digitalWrite(GREEN,0);

delay(2500);


Turns the Yellow LED ON.

Turns Red and Green OFF.

Stays in this state for 2.5 seconds.

Green Light

digitalWrite(RED,0);
digitalWrite(YELLOW,0);
digitalWrite(GREEN,1);

delay(5000);


Turns the Green LED ON.

Turns Red and Yellow OFF.

Stays in this state for 5 seconds.

4. Looping

After Green, the loop function ends. Arduino automatically restarts the loop, so the cycle repeats forever:
Red (5s) → Yellow (2.5s) → Green (5s) → Red ...
