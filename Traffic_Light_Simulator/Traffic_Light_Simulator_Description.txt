This is a simple Arduino program (written in C/C++ for the Arduino IDE) that simulates a traffic light using three LEDs (Red, Yellow, and Green) connected to digital pins. The LEDs turn on in a sequence that mimics a real traffic light cycle:

Code Breakdown
Pin Definitions
#define RED 2
#define YELLOW 3
#define GREEN 4


→ Assigns meaningful names (RED, YELLOW, GREEN) to digital pins 2, 3, and 4 for better readability.

void setup()

Runs once when the Arduino starts or resets.

pinMode(RED, OUTPUT);
pinMode(YELLOW, OUTPUT);
pinMode(GREEN, OUTPUT);


→ Configures all three LED pins as output pins.

void loop()

Runs continuously in a cycle:

digitalWrite(RED, HIGH);      // Red ON
digitalWrite(YELLOW, LOW);
digitalWrite(GREEN, LOW);
delay(5000);                  // Red for 5 seconds

digitalWrite(RED, LOW);
digitalWrite(YELLOW, LOW);
digitalWrite(GREEN, HIGH);    // Green ON
delay(5000);                  // Green for 5 seconds

digitalWrite(RED, LOW);
digitalWrite(YELLOW, HIGH);   // Yellow ON
digitalWrite(GREEN, LOW);
delay(2000);                  // Yellow for 2 seconds


→ Red lights for stop, Green lights for go, Yellow lights for caution.
→ The sequence repeats indefinitely, simulating a traffic light.

Result

The LEDs mimic a real traffic light, switching from Red → Green → Yellow → Red continuously.
