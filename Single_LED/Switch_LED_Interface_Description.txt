This is an Arduino program that controls an LED (on pin 13) based on the state of a digital input (on pin 12).

Here’s the explanation:

void setup()

Runs once when the Arduino starts.

pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
→ Configures pin 13 as an output (to control an LED).

pinMode(12, INPUT);
→ Configures pin 12 as an input (to read a digital signal, e.g., from a button or switch).

void loop()

Runs repeatedly in a cycle.

int a;
→ Declares an integer variable a.

a = digitalRead(12);
→ Reads the logic level (HIGH = 1 or LOW = 0) from pin 12 and stores it in a.

if(a==1)
→ Checks if pin 12 is HIGH.

If yes → digitalWrite(13, HIGH); turns ON the LED.

Else → digitalWrite(13, LOW); turns OFF the LED.
