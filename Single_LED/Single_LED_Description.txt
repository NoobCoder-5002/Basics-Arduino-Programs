This is a simple Arduino program (written in C/C++ for the Arduino IDE) that makes the built-in LED on pin 13 blink on and off with a 2-second interval.

Here’s the breakdown:

void setup()

Runs once when the Arduino starts or resets.

pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
→ Configures digital pin 13 as an output pin (on most Arduino boards, pin 13 has a built-in LED).

void loop()

Runs continuously in a cycle.

digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
→ Turns ON the LED (applies 5V to pin 13).

delay(2000);
→ Waits for 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds) with the LED on.

digitalWrite(13, LOW);
→ Turns OFF the LED.

delay(2000);
→ Waits another 2 seconds with the LED off.

Then the cycle repeats forever.
