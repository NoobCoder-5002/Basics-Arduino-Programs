This is a simple Arduino program (written in C/C++ for the Arduino IDE) that makes multiple LEDs connected to digital pins turn on one by one in sequence, creating a chasing light effect. After reaching the last LED, the sequence repeats from the first LED.

Code Breakdown
Pin Definitions
#define LED1 1
#define LED2 2
#define LED3 3
#define LED4 4
#define LED5 5
#define LED6 6
#define LED7 7


→ Assigns meaningful names (LED1–LED7) to Arduino digital pins 1–7.
→ Makes the code easier to read and maintain.

void setup()

Runs once when the Arduino starts or resets.

pinMode(1, OUTPUT);
pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
pinMode(3, OUTPUT);
pinMode(4, OUTPUT);
pinMode(5, OUTPUT);
pinMode(6, OUTPUT);
pinMode(7, OUTPUT);


→ Configures all LED pins as output pins so the Arduino can turn them on/off.

void loop()

Runs continuously in a cycle.

digitalWrite(LED1, HIGH);
delay(500);
digitalWrite(LED1, LOW);
delay(1000);


→ Turns LED1 ON for 500 ms, then OFF, followed by a 1-second pause.

This same pattern is repeated for LED2 → LED3 → ... → LED7, creating a sequential chasing effect.

Result

LEDs connected to pins 1–7 turn ON one by one, each staying on for 0.5 seconds with a 1-second gap between them.

After the last LED turns off, the sequence repeats indefinitely, producing a simple LED chaser effect.
