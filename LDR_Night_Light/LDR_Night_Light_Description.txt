# Automatic Night-Light System (LDR)

### Project Description
This project creates an Automatic Night-Light system. It uses an LDR (Photoresistor) to sense the intensity of ambient light and triggers an LED when the environment becomes dark.

**How it works:** An LDR’s resistance changes based on light intensity. In bright light, its resistance is low; in the dark, its resistance is high.

**The Logic:** The Arduino reads an analog voltage from a voltage divider circuit. When the value falls below a specific threshold (meaning it has become dark), the Arduino sends a HIGH signal to turn on the LED.
