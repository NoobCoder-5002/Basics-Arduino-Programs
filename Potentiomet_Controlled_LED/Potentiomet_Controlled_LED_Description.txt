This Arduino program controls the brightness of an LED connected to pin 11 using a potentiometer connected to analog pin A0. As you rotate the potentiometer, the LED gradually changes brightness from OFF (dim) to fully ON (bright).

Code Breakdown
#define POT A0
#define LED 11


POT → Potentiometer is connected to analog input pin A0.

LED → LED is connected to digital pin 11 

void setup(){
    pinMode(11,OUTPUT);
    pinMode(POT,INPUT);
}


Configures pin 11 as an output (for LED).

Configures A0 as input (for reading potentiometer).

void loop(){
    int POT_value = analogRead(POT);  
    int Brightness = map(POT_value,0,1023,0,255);  
    analogWrite(LED, Brightness);
}


analogRead(POT)
Reads the potentiometer’s value → range 0–1023.

map(POT_value, 0, 1023, 0, 255)
Converts the 10-bit analog reading into an 8-bit PWM value (0–255).

analogWrite(LED, Brightness)
Sends PWM signal to the LED, making its brightness proportional to the potentiometer’s position.
